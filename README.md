## CNN-based Prediction of Mechanical Properties in Unidirectional Fiber-Reinforced Composites using Physics-Guided Features  
### 물리적 특징을 활용한 CNN 기반 단방향 섬유 강화 복합재의 기계적 특성 예측

This repository contains the extended abstract and poster presented at the KSME Conference 2025. The study investigates the prediction of key mechanical properties—such as Young’s modulus, ultimate tensile strength, and fracture toughness—of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. To improve accuracy and generalization, the model incorporates physics-guided scalar features derived from classical failure criteria, including Hashin, Tsai–Wu, and Puck criterion.

The repository is intended for public viewing during the conference. The associated master’s thesis and source code will be made available via a separate repository in the near future.
